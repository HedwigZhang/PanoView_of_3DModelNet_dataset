# PanoView_of_3DModelNet_dataset
Panorama view of 3D data under Matlab files
Most of code referred from https://github.com/bgshih/deeppano (DeepPano: Deep Panoramic Representation for 3-D Shape Recognition)

We apply this method to get the panorama view of the ModelNet10 and ModelNet40 data. (http://modelnet.cs.princeton.edu/)

modelNet10.m and modelNet40/m are the main function to get the full data, which will be save in '.mat' file.
In addition, getInformation.m and get_panoview.m are two files we added for the data processing.

exp_proj_panoview.m show the example.
